### 4. Azure Infrastructure Testing

#### Core Services Deployment
- **Resource Group**: Successfully created and managed
- **Virtual Network**: Network topology and subnet configuration
- **App Service**: Web application hosting and configuration
- **SQL Database**: Database server and database creation
- **Key Vault**: Secure credential storage and access policies
- **Storage Account**: Blob storage with private endpoints
- **Application Gateway**: Load balancer and SSL termination

#### Network Security Testing
- **Private Endpoints**: SQL and Storage private connectivity
- **Network Security Groups**: Firewall rules and access controls
- **VNet Integration**: App Service virtual network integration
- **Application Gateway**: Public-facing load balancer configuration

### 5. Application Gateway Deep Dive Testing

#### Issue Resolution Process
- **Problem Identification**: Diagnosed 502 Bad Gateway error
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified HTTP/HTTPS protocol mismatch
- **Configuration Fix**: Updated backend settings to use HTTPS
- **Health Probe Implementation**: Added proper health monitoring
- **Validation Testing**: Confirmed 200 OK response after fix

#### Technical Details Tested
- **Backend Protocol**: HTTP â†’ HTTPS conversion
- **SSL Certificate Handling**: Host name picking for Azure App Services
- **Health Probes**: HTTPS health checking configuration
- **Status Code Validation**: Proper response code handling

### 6. Security and Compliance Testing

#### Authentication Security
- **OIDC vs Service Principal Keys**: Implemented keyless authentication
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions configured
- **Federated Identity**: Modern authentication flow implementation
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded credentials in repository

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Private Endpoints**: Database and storage isolated from internet
- **HTTPS Only**: Web applications enforce HTTPS
- **Network Segmentation**: Proper subnet isolation
- **Key Vault Integration**: Secure credential storage and retrieval

### 7. Operational Testing

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Azure Resource Health**: All resources report healthy status
- **Application Gateway Health**: Backend health monitoring working
- **Deployment Logs**: Comprehensive logging in GitHub Actions
- **Terraform State**: State file management and locking

#### Disaster Recovery
- **Infrastructure Recreation**: Can rebuild entire environment from code
- **State Management**: Remote state storage in Azure Storage
- **Backup Procedures**: Configuration and state backup strategies
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/prod environments
